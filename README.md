# Reva Project 1
With digital ad spending predicted to reach nearly $500 billion globally by 2025, the industry is more focused than ever before on combating digital transaction fraud. This project is an attempt to build a machine learning Model to detect any transaction frauds in Finical systems . This fraud prevention system will actually  try saving consumers millions of dollars per year. Researchers from the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS) wants to improve this figure and there are been immense studies going in this area, while also improving the customer experience. With higher accuracy fraud detection models. IEEE-CIS works across a variety of AI and machine learning areas, including deep neural networks. Fraud represents a significant problem for financial institutions, and reliable fraud detection is generally challenging. Here we demonstrate how to train a machine learning model on a real-world dataset, and how to employ techniques like oversampling and threshold moving to address class imbalance.Historically, fraud detection has been performed by analysts who are responsible for identifying and tracing suspicious patterns in the data. The rapid increase of online transactions, often associated with online shopping, mobile payments etc., has made this approach unfeasible. A modern transaction dataset has hundreds of dimensions, millions of records, and is constantly updated in an online fashion. Auxiliary techniques like relying on card holders to report fraudulent transactions have unfortunately proven to be ineffective.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16812994/225561474-2fe1a327-57ec-4795-abca-cb751e9f02c0.png)
